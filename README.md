#  Project 6 | Completed charity: water Game
Time to finalize the game you’re building for charity: water and turn it into a more polished, playable experience — something that feels complete, engaging, and aligned with charity: water's mission and brand.

#  Project Steps Overview:
This is your chance to level up what you've already built! The core functionality is already in place. Now it's time to polish, enhance, and finalize your game by:
- Making it more enjoyable and engaging to play
- Strengthening its connection to charity: water's mission and brand
Adding thoughtful touches that improve the overall experience

## Implement Game Improvements
No matter what game you built — whether you started from a template or created your own — your final version should include these enhancements:
- Add difficulty modes (e.g. Easy, Normal, and Hard) that change the game’s goals, pace, or rules. For example, you might set a different number of points for the  win conditions on each level, or shorten the time available to users to reach a goal as the difficulty level increases.
- Add, change, or remove elements from the DOM when players interact with them (depending on which makes the most sense for your game). For example, water drops disappear when clicked, or cans are removed when collected. If you're building your own game, think about what elements players collect, defeat, or interact with—and how those should disappear in response. For example, clearing completed tasks or removing obstacles after a collision.
- Include a page element or section (like a footer) with links to charity: water’s website and donation pages.
- Use a font that matches or closely resembles the one in charity: water’s brand guidelines, and apply it to your game’s text for a more on-brand look.
